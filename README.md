Random Erasing data augmentation technique randomly erases a rectangular region of an image. This helps the model become more robust to occlusion, which is when part of the object is hidden from view.

p is the probability of applying random erasing to the image. A value of 1 means it's applied to every image, while a lower value introduces randomness.

The sl and sh parameters control the allowed minimum and maximum sizes of the erased region, respectively. A higher sl value will result in larger erased regions, while a lower sh value will result in smaller erased regions.

The r1 parameter controls the aspect ratio of the erased region. A higher r1 value will result in taller erased regions, while a lower r1 value will result in wider erased regions.
